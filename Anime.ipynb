    "- Develop an **unsupervised learning** model to recommend anime based on user preferences.  \n",
    "- Perform **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns in the dataset.  \n",
    "- Implement **clustering algorithms** (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) for grouping similar anime.  \n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.  \n",
    "- Submit predictions to the **Kaggle Challenge Leaderboard** for evaluation.  \n",
